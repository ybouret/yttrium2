         * ERROR HANDLING:
         *
         * The JPEG library's standard error handler (jerror.c) is divided into
         * several "methods" which you can override individually.  This lets you
         * adjust the behavior without duplicating a lot of code, which you might
         * have to update with each future release.
         *
         * Our example here shows how to override the "error_exit" method so that
         * control is returned to the library's caller when a fatal error occurs,
         * rather than calling exit() as the standard error_exit method does.
         *
         * We use C's setjmp/longjmp facility to return control.  This means that the
         * routine which calls the JPEG library must first execute a setjmp() call to
         * establish the return point.  We want the replacement error_exit to do a
         * longjmp().  But we need to make the setjmp buffer accessible to the
         * error_exit routine.  To do this, we make a private extension of the
         * standard JPEG error handler object.  (If we were using C++, we'd say we
         * were making a subclass of the regular error handler.)
         *
         * Here's the extended error handler struct:
